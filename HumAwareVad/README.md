## 📌 Overview
**HumAware-VAD** is a fine-tuned version of the **[Silero-VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/tree/master)** model, trained to distinguish **humming from actual speech**. Standard Voice Activity Detection (VAD) models, including Silero-VAD, often misclassify humming as speech, leading to inaccurate speech segmentation. HumAware-VAD improves upon this by leveraging a custom dataset (**[HumSpeechBlend](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CuriousMonkey7/HumSpeechBlend)**) to enhance speech detection accuracy in the presence of humming.

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary goal of **HumAware-VAD** is to:
- Reduce **false positives** where humming is mistakenly detected as speech.
- Enhance **speech segmentation accuracy** in real-world applications.
- Improve VAD performance for tasks involving **music, background noise, and vocal sounds**.

## 🗂️ Model Details
- **Base Model**: [Silero-VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/tree/master)
- **Fine-tuning Dataset**: [HumSpeechBlend](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CuriousMonkey7/HumSpeechBlend)
- **Format**: JIT (TorchScript)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Inference Speed**: Real-time

## 🚀 Using HumAware-VAD with FastRTC
You can integrate **HumAware-VAD** with **FastRTC** for real-time voice activity detection in streaming applications.

### Installation
```sh
pip install humaware-vad
```

### Clone the this Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CuriousMonkey7/HumAwareVad.git
cd HumAwareVad
```
Run the script:
```sh
python app.py
```

## ⚠️ Limitations
- The model may **miss speech detection** if the user speaks too softly.
- Works best for detecting **"mhm" humming sounds**.
- May also work for sounds like **"la la la"** or **"da da da"**, but with **varying accuracy**.
